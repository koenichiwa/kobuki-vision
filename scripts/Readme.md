# Instructions

In order to run these scripts you will first have to make sure that all requirements are met.
This can easily be done using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Due to ros being slow as fuck in updating Python you will need to use Python 2.7

Once all requirements are met the script can be run using python app.py

This will start the web server and the page will be available at 

```
localhost:5000
```
